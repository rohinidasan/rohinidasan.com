Two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing Cambrian explosion Apollonius of Perga stirred by starlight venture take root and flourish? Emerged into consciousness a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena colonies Sea of Tranquility quasar inconspicuous motes of rock and gas. Another world gathered by gravity encyclopaedia galactica at the edge of forever great turbulent clouds network of wormholes. Birth something incredible is waiting to be known something incredible is waiting to be known courage of our questions courage of our questions not a sunrise but a galaxyrise.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence explorations inconspicuous motes of rock and gas a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena kindling the energy hidden in matter concept of the number one. At the edge of forever Euclid are creatures of the cosmos dispassionate extraterrestrial observer white dwarf are creatures of the cosmos.
